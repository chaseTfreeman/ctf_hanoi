## Project Workflow
Performing- Seems to be no wire frames. But the mental model for towers is pretty simple. Despite that, wireframes can be really valuable when prototyping. Psuedocode and user stories look great.

## Technical Requirements
Performing- You got most of the functionality to work. To include drag and drop as well! Great job and kudos to your determination on getting the drag and drop to work. Still not fully functional though. One of the biggest rules is missing for towers of hanoi. I have no doubts that you'll be able to figure this out.

## Code Quality
Performing - Code is pretty well indented and has decent levels of abstraction. There's a bit of unDRY code for the droppable interfaces. I would love to see more comments of some of the more complicated pieces of your code base.

## Creativity Interface
Performing/Progressing - The interface is a bit lackluster. A couple more hours of styling would greatly improve the user experience. Again, one of the biggest pieces of functionality for towers is missing( re: tech requirements). I do really like the ability to dynamically generate number of discs

## Overall
Really great work Chase. I loved the determination you demonstrated in getting the jQuery UI plugin to work. Though, I would encourage you to keep practicing the basic skills we learned throughout Unit 1. Sometimes we, as developers, want to use the next best cool platform/technology and we miss the mark because we didn't code the things we knew solidly. I don't think that you'll run into this pitfall too frequently, but often times I'll make this same mistake. IE, forcing a library i'm not 100% comfortable with. That said, you made it work. Great work!
