 - Header/Title to be centered on page.
 - Game board (container Div) to be centered beneath the header
 - The Game board will contain three divs #pegContainer (labeled A/B/C) which will
    EACH contain another div nearly equal in size (#pegA, #pegB, #pegC)
 - #pegs A, B, & C will all be 'ui-droppable' and have
    the id #pegA,B,C. (all styled the same).
 - The height of #pegContainers & #pegA/B/C will be calculated based on
  the height of however many discs there are (determined by the heigh of
   Discs which is constant)
 - Ideally, the user will be able to choose the number of discs they would
   like to use and this will cause the change in div heights to accomodate
   the 'draggable/droppable' properties of the divs

 Functionality:
 - Drag and drop from one #peg to the another:
  FEATURES:
      - ***Toggle the ability to select discs only if they are on the top.
            ________________________________________________
              Enable top disc on first peg.

              EXAMPLE CODE: lines 224-244

      -.on("Mouseover"), highlight/focus on the the chosen disc.
      -***figure out drag/drop and if .append is needed.
            ________________________________________________
            EXAMPLE CODE: Lines 252-264;
              - Uses discs.css('top',....) and append/prepend to order
                the discs on top of each other in the divs
            ________________________________________________
      -adjust height of #pegContainer to expand and fit sum of all discs height (min-height?)
